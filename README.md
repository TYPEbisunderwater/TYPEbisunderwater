- 👋 Hi, I'm Zhao Yuxin, thanks for visiting my Github.
- 👀 I’m interested in ML, DS, Economics and everything related to these thing
 
- 🌱 I graduated from Northwestern Polytechnical University with a bachelor's degree in economics
- 🌱 I was admitted by the Master of Data Science program at the University of Southern California. 
-     However due to 10043 policy restrictions, I was forced to drop out.
     
- 💞️ I am looking for a supervisor who is interested in enrolling PhD students and I am willing to pay for all the study and research expenses myself. (I would appreciate it if you could give me a chance)
- I'm willing to try everything I've touched and haven't touched. Although it takes me a little time to build my interest in an unfamiliar event, it usually takes less than 1 week. I am also very willing to do more in-depth research and learning.

- 📫 My email-> (zhaoyuxi@usc.edu); My Phone number +8615319985665; You are welcome to contact me anytime！
